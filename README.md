# Scripts
Several useful scripts that I wrote for automation of tasks.

# Numlock.vbs
This VisualBasic Script emulate NumLock key press.

# Hedonism_tasks_parser.py
This is script parse exported chat with Hedonism_bot from Telegram and extract all tasks from messages. Then wrote tasks names and text in much pretty format.
